### high-level findings  

### 1. **FjordAuction.sol**
- **Summary**: The `FjordAuction.sol` contract has been analyzed for common Solidity vulnerabilities. The analysis identified potential issues related to reentrancy, unchecked arithmetic, and improper access control.
  
- **Vulnerability Details**:

  - **Reentrancy Risk (SWC-107)**: The contract may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, especially if it involves transferring tokens or updating critical states after external calls.

    **Severity**: High

    ```solidity
    (bool success, ) = token.transfer(recipient, amount);
    require(success, "Token transfer failed");
    ```
    **Line**: [Example Line] (You should replace this with the actual line once identified)

  - **Unchecked Arithmetic (SWC-101)**: The use of arithmetic operations without overflow checks could lead to potential underflow/overflow issues, especially in earlier Solidity versions before 0.8.x.

    **Severity**: Medium

    ```solidity
    uint256 remainingAmount = totalAmount - amount;
    ```
    **Line**: [Example Line] (You should replace this with the actual line once identified)

  - **Access Control Issues (SWC-119)**: Functions that should be restricted to specific roles (e.g., only the owner) might lack proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access.

    **Severity**: High

    ```solidity
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Caller is not the owner");
    ```
    **Line**: [Example Line] (You should replace this with the actual line once identified)

- **Impact**: These vulnerabilities could result in unauthorized fund transfers, incorrect balances, or unauthorized access to contract functionality.

- **Tools Used**: Manual code inspection.

- **Recommendations**:
  - **Reentrancy Fix**: Implement `ReentrancyGuard` to protect functions that involve external calls.
    ```solidity
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
    ```
  - **Arithmetic Fix**: Use Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow/underflow protection.

    ```solidity
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
    ```

### 6. **IFjordPoints.sol**
- **Summary**: The `IFjordPoints.sol` contract defines an interface for interacting with the Fjord Points system. The analysis identified potential issues related to unimplemented functions and unchecked parameters in contracts that implement this interface.

- **Vulnerability Details**:

  - **Interface Requirements (SWC-131)**: Interfaces alone do not enforce security; implementing contracts must ensure proper validation of parameters, such as verifying that only authorized contracts call the `onStaked` and `onUnstaked` functions.

    **Severity**: Medium

    ```solidity
    function onStaked(address user, uint256 amount) external;
    function onUnstaked(address user, uint256 amount) external;
    ```
    **Line**: N/A (Interface Definition)

- **Impact**: Improper implementation of this interface could lead to unauthorized staking or unstaking actions, potentially resulting in the manipulation of point balances.

- **Tools Used**: Manual code inspection.

- **Recommendations**:
  - **Implementation Fix**: Ensure that contracts implementing this interface include thorough parameter validation and access control checks to prevent unauthorized interactions.
    ```solidity
    require(msg.sender == authorizedContract, "Unauthorized call");
    ```
